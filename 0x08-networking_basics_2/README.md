# Networking basics #1

In this project, I continued to learn about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Change your home IP**
  * [0-change_your_home_IP](./0-change_your_home_IP): Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server as follows:
  * `localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.2`
  * `facebook.com` resolves to `8.8.8.8`

* **1. Show attached IPs**
  * [1-show_attached_IPs](./1-show_attached_IPs): Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IP's on the machine.

* **2. Port listening on localhost**
  * [100-port_listening_on_localhost](./100-port_listening_on_localhost): Bash script that listens on port `98` on `localhost`.


## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What is localhost/127.0.0.1
* What is 0.0.0.0
* What is /etc/hosts
* How to display your machine’s active network interfaces
